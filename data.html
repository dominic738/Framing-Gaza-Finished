    <h3>Definitions: Genocide and War</h3>
  </div>
  
  <h2>War</h2>

  <p> War is defined as two government-run militias with opposing conflicts, with a function to cause damage against each other until one side is overpowered and so will concede. In International Law, Jus Ad Bellum (Just War Law) theorizes that a war is justified if it has the proper authority and adequate declaration, just cause, and that it is a proportional response to meet the resolution. Contemporary ideas recognize war as a functional means to an end. For a conflict to be a “war,” a possibility of resolution must exist. The news media has been denoting the Hamas/Israel conflict as a war. However, with some experts claiming a resolution with Israel is impossible and  some academics calling it “the most asymmetrical war ever,” is it accurate to call the Israel/Palestine conflict a war? </p>

  <h2>Genocide</h2>

  <p>Genocide defines the intentional and often violent attempt to partially or wholly remove or destroy a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. Genocide Convention - an international treaty that criminalizes genocide and obligates state parties to pursue the enforcement of its prohibition. It was the first legal instrument to codify genocide as a crime and the first human rights treaty unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. <br> </br>
  The Convention defines genocide as any of five "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group." These five acts include killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children out of the group. Victims are targeted because of their real or perceived membership of a group, not randomly.[6] The convention further criminalizes "complicity, attempt, or incitement of its commission." Member states are prohibited from engaging in genocide and obligated to pursue the enforcement of this prohibition.</p>

  <h2>Israel</h2>

  <p>If war exists to overpower or “win,” Israel has well beyond reached the time to cease. After Israel denied ceasefire concessions and broken them, and there are still 1.1 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza, being told to leave through pamphlets falling from the sky and landing amongst the wreckage of homes. With a blockade trapping them inside and nowhere to go, Israel continues to invade. <br> </br>


  In 2015, the International Criminal Court opened an investigation against Israel and concluded there was “is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity committed on the territory of Palestine – the Gaza Strip and West Bank.” These include targeting civilians, killing hostages and surrendered war prisoners, collective punishment, induced famine and starvation, targeting medics, targeting journalists, sexual violence, pillaging, forced population transfer or displacement, and genocide.

    <h3>Examining Evidence of Genocide in Gaza Through Data</h3>
  </div>

  <h2>About the Data</h2>

  <p>

The Data Collection process in Gaza highlights the use of genocidal tactics. Casualties in war zones are primarily composed through hospital and morgue records and military reports. However, the traditional collection system is not always possible. This is due to hospitals being targeted, infrastructure crumbling, etc. 

<br></br>

In Gaza, Hamas and the Ministry of Health first followed traditional collection systems using hospitals and morgues. However, during the war, Gaza’s healthcare system has been targeted, a violation of international law. As shown in the New York Times, out of Gazas’s 37 hospitals, only 16 are partially functional. Additionally, healthcare personnal have been targeted. Recently, 15 first responders have been killed by the IDF (Israel Military). Although the Israeli government tried to negate this, video and witness evidence validated that they were unjustly killed. Additionally, the IDF has recognized that they attacked hospitals that were suspected of treating Hamas soldiers, which is still a violation of international law.  </p>

<p>

Due to these circumstances, the Ministry of Health shifted collecting fatalities to media reports, journalist and family submissions. 

</p>

<p>

However, as a result of these new collection procedures, Israel has discredited and questioned the accuracy of the death toll reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health. By doing this, Israel is trying to decrease the number of deaths reported. They are not only limiting the number of casualties due to the negative limelight, they are giving these victims a second death in the form of erasure. Despite Israel’s statement, the media continues to use these numbers reported by the Ministry of Health with attribution. 

</p>

<p>
Given these challenges, our data analysis draws from multiple independent sources to ensure accuracy and minimize bias. We aggregated information from casualty tracking databases, international humanitarian organizations, media investigations, and academic studies, including:

    <h3>Overview of Sources</h3>
  </div>


<h2>Tech for Palestine</h2>
<p>
The Tech for Palestine dataset consists of a timeseries of deaths. The data was sourced fro Gaza's Ministry of Health Telegram and Gaza's Government Media Office Telegram channel, sources that have both had to change the way they count deaths due to reasons stated above. The dataset spans from October 7th, 2023 to March 28th, 2025. Gaza's Ministry of Health has historically been trusted by both the United States and Israeli intelligence.</p>

<h2> OCHA </h2>
<p>
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) data consists of Palestinian and Israeli casualties and injuries. The data was collected from Gaza's Ministry of Health and Israeli authorities.
</p>

<h2> ACLED </h2>

<p>

The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) dataset consists of over 15000 instances of explosions/remote violence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank from the Military Forces of Israel. The data was sourced from a variety of news sources including Quds News Network, Ma'an News Agency, and various others. Each event contains a description of the incident alongside the number of fatalities. The events indicated as civilian targeting or non-civilian targeting. How the ACLED determines these factors is stated in their codebook: </p>

<p class="quote">
  ACLED defines ‘Explosions/Remote violence’ events as incidents in which one side uses
weapon types that, by their nature, are at range and widely destructive. The weapons
used in ‘Explosions/Remote violence’ events are explosive devices, including but not
limited to: bombs, grenades, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), artillery fire or shelling,
missile attacks, air or drone strikes, and other widely destructive heavy weapons or
chemical weapons. Suicide attacks using explosives also fall under this category. When
an ‘Explosions/Remote violence’ event is reported in the context of an ongoing battle, it
is merged and recorded as a single ‘Battles’ event. ‘Explosions/Remote violence’ can be
used against armed agents as well as civilians. ‘Explosions/Remote violence’ events where
civilians are the main or only target will be tagged with “Civilians targeted” in the ‘Civilian
targeting’ column.  — <a href="https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/10/ACLED-Codebook-2024-7-Oct.-2024.pdf" target="_blank">ACLED Codebook (p. 16)</a>
</p>


<br></br>

<h2> AOVA </h2>

<p>The Action on Armed Violence article provides estimates on the number and proportion of civilian casualties in Gaza based on data from the Gaza Ministry of Health.

<h2> World Population Review </h2>
<p>
The World Population Review provides various countries' total deaths during World War II. These deaths are separated into military deaths, civilian deaths via military, and civilian deaths via famine and disease. We will only be looking the proprtion of military deaths versus civilian deaths in order to compare these to Palestine's estimated civilian death proprortions, however it is important to note the the undercount due to famine deaths.

By excluding famine and disease related deaths from our comparison, we are undercounting the full civilian toll of Palestine. 
This is significant because, even with this undercount, Palestine’s current proportion of civilian deaths from direct violence alone already rivals civilian casualty rates seen during World War II. 

The severity of civilian targeting in Gaza is even more pronounced when considering that famine-related fatalities, which are increasingly likely under current conditions, have not yet been fully realized or recorded.</p>

    <p> The pie charts on the left shows the severity of Israel's bombing and their stategy of carpet bombing. About a third of Israel's bombings result in at least one Palestinian casualty. This does not mean that two-thirds result in no harm at all as often times many are injured from the attacks or vital resources are destroyed. This bombing pattern resembles saturation bombing which attempts to cover an area rather than attack a specific target. <br></br> The pie chart on the right shows that over 90% of all Isreali explosive attacks were considered civilian targeting. This indicates that a majority of the violence was not directed at military but rather civilian populations. </p>

   <p>
  This visualization shows that women and children make up the majority of the casualties in Gaza. Combined, women and children make up at least 60% of all civilian casualties with the highest proportions reaching around 80%. It is important to note that the combined proprtion is only women and children, so the real proportion of civilian casualties in Gaza is most likely higher, as groups such as elderly men and men not in combat are not counted. <br></br> This graph also shows extrapolated values in times where reports were missing. Tech For Palestine states their methodology regarding these values below: </p> 

  <p class = "quote">
  Extrapolated (ext_ fields)

Since official numbers weren't always available, and it can be useful to have a timeseries where all dates have values, we're providing the same official fields in extrapolated form using the following methodology:
  <br></br>

    -- if the missing field was a cumulative one and we had an official report for a daily killed or injury count, we calculate the cumulative using the daily increment
    <br></br>
    -- if the missing field was a daily increment and we had cumulative counts, we subtracted the reported cumulative count from the prior period for the missing daily count
    <br></br>
    -- if we were missing both sets of numbers for a given reporting period we average the difference between surrounding periods -

    <h3>How Does This Compare To Past Wars And Genocides?</h3>

  </iframe>


  <p>
  On the left side of this graph, many of the Allied powers in WWII, such as the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, show high proportions of military deaths during the war. This is mainly due to fighting taking place overseas and large armies. 

  <br></br>
  On the right side of this graph, countries that faced invasions and genocidal campaigns are shown with much higher civilian death proportions. 



  <br></br> Next to these WWII countires are three different estimates of Gaza's civilian casualties proportions. The lowest being the current combined proportion of women and children casualties based on the cumulative stacked area chart shown earlier. The next is the average combined women and children proportions from the same chart. The highest estimate is from the independent organization Action On Armed Violence (AOVA). All these estimated are conservative lower bounds, meaning the true proprtion is likely even higher.

  <p>These graphs represent the total asymmetry in Palestinian deaths versus Israeli deaths. Just six days after October 7th, 2023, the Palestian death total exceeded Israel's total death toll from April 8th, 2025, 549 days later. Additionally, Palestinians have suffered over 28 times more casualties and 14 times more injuries than Israelis.


  </p>
  





  <div class = "data-block hidden-data">
    <h3>Data Implications and Considerations</h3>
  </div>



  

  <p> The data strongly supports the claim that Israel is committing genocide, as evidenced by the high proportions of women and children among the casualties and the overwhelming targeting of civilians. 

  Additionally, the relatively small number of Israeli deaths suggests that Palestinian resistance is minimal, further undermining the framing of this conflict as a "war" and instead revealing its one-sided nature.</p>

  <!-- Discuss Johnson and Markup Bodies -->

  <p> It is extremely important to recognize the way in which this data shapes discussions and the image of Palestinians. Jessica Marie Johnson writes in her essay "Markup Bodies" about the ways in Black bodies and Black narratives are shaped by the data that they're represented in. Data can both empower and dehumanize communities. Johnson describes how database technologies have changed perceptions of the slave trade, specifically in the number of women and children involved. However, she explains that even well-intentioned efforts can transform people into units of measurement, which in attempts to correct have led to altered histories. <br></br>Johnson accounts: </p>

    
    <p class = "quote"> Abolitionists generated content ot provoke a hyperemotional resonse in readers -- an excessive reproduction of black death and pain to overcompensate for a dense archive of enslaved integers generated across centuries...Time traveling centuries later, cliometricians' desire to -- and failure to -- excise emotion from the slavery debates by centering the numbers themselves proved that statistics alone also did not make the history of bondage any easier to digest or the terms of redress more transparent" (Johnson 65). </p>

    <br></br>

  <p>
  Our data does not serve to present Palestinians as statistics of death or to provoke detached emotional shock. We instead aim to humanize the Palestinian experience by revealing the systemic violence they endure; violence that risks being erased if reduced to numbers alone. The goal is not to degreade Palestinian death into numbers, but, instead to reveal the violence that made these deaths inevitable and to hold accountable the bombings, blockades, apartheid laws, and colonial systems that continue to destroy Palestinian life.

  <br></br>

  As Johnson explains, data is not neutral. It either participates in the erasure of stories and communities, or challenges it.
