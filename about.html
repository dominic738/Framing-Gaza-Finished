<h1> US Reasoning for Pro-Israel Sentiment</h1>

<section id="data">
  


    <h2>Historical and Strategic Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      The US ties to Israel began before its inception. The then current President <strong>Harry Truman</strong> was sympathetic to Zionism because of his Evangelical Christian upbringing. The U.S Evangelical population often use biblical reasonings for their support of Israel as it sees Jewish people as the descendants of biblical Israelites and often refer to the Bible verse <strong>Genesis 12:3</strong> — “I will bless those who bless you and I will curse those who curse you and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, the U.S. saw Israel as a method of containing the <strong>Soviet influence</strong> in the Middle East during the Cold War. However, after the Cold War, the US continued to have a close relationship with Israel, seeing it as a “<strong>force of stability</strong>” in the region and has categorized itself as playing an integral role in supporting peace in the Middle East.
    </p>



    <h2>Public Support and Shared Values</h2>
    <p>
      An integral part of the U.S government's support is due to the <strong>American public's sympathy for Israel</strong>. Historically, there has been a large pro-Israel sympathy in the U.S., due to religious connections from both the <strong>Jewish and Evangelical Christian populations</strong>, regardless of political party.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a strong view of “<strong>shared values</strong>” between the U.S public and Israel. Israel is considered part of the “Western World,” with inclusion in largely European spaces like <strong>Eurovision</strong> and <strong>European Soccer Leagues</strong>. This stems from shared ideas of “<strong>whiteness</strong>” and <strong>Islamophobic sentiment</strong>. These affinities influence government actions, such as the U.S. giving Israel <strong>over $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually</strong>.

    <h2>Shifting Public Opinion</h2>
    <p>
      However, it is important to note that U.S. public sentiment has been changing. Now, more than <strong>half of U.S. adults (53%)</strong> express “an unfavorable opinion of Israel,” up from 42% in March 2022 — before the <strong>Hamas attack of Oct. 7, 2023</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change reflects increased awareness and criticism of Israel’s military actions and human rights violations. This evolving sentiment may lead to <strong>increased pressure on lawmakers</strong> to reevaluate their stance on U.S.-Israel relations and recognize the ongoing conflict as a potential <strong>genocide</strong>.
