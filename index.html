    <h3>What is 'home'?</h3>
  </div>




    <h2> Is it where you lived in your childhood?
  Is it where your lineage is from? 
  Where your mother’s cooking is? Where the streets exist in a map of memory?
  Is it the land that cradled your ancestors? Or the future you build for your children?

For many, home is a right so deeply assumed that it barely needs defending. But for Palestinians, the concept of home has long been contested, denied, and erased — not by natural disaster or personal misfortune, but by political violence. Palestine has been a home for ancient kingdoms in Mesopotamia, Ottoman Turks of all (majority muslim) abrahamic religions during the Ottoman Empire, Polish refugees fleeing WWII, and resilient Palestinians still reside on the now-occupied territory between the (Jordan) river and the (Mediterranean) sea today.

On October 7th, 2023, the Western media news headlines were ablaze with a ‘new’ story. A radical Muslim terrorist organization known as Hamas attacked "Israel," killing 1,200 civilians and kidnapping almost 300 more Israeli hostages, taking them back to the Gaza Strip indefinitely. Hamas' attack ignited Israel to launch a swift and valiant defense to protect the innocent nation from these dangerous terrorists.

And just like that, a war had begun… right?

At least, this was the story all over the headlines in the West. The distinction between war and ethnic cleansing is often blurred, yet language shapes global responses and accountability. U.S. media frequently represents this area as “in conflict” or in “war” or even as a “terrorist area,” but when we analyze the data does it align more closely with a war or a genocide? Using a series of quantitative data, statistical analysis, qualitative conceptual understandings and contextual historical storytelling, we will interrogate the U.S.’s framing of Gaza in media, explore the philosophical and ethical distinctions and classifications of “war” or “genocide,” and compare the implications of statistical patterns in Gaza with past genocides or wars. In this way, we aim to understand the ongoing conflict beyond the narrative presented by the U.S. government.
